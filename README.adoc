= A Git difftool for BPMN-files

`bpmn-diff` allows visual diffing of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation[BPMN-files] from the commandline. It can also easily be integrated as a link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool[difftool for Git].

Note that this tool is possible in only possible due to the awesome link:https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-diffing[bpmn-js-diffing] library (see here for the link:https://demo.bpmn.io/diff[online version]).
At it's core, it is a repackaging/embeeded version of this library.

The application-shell is based on link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] and thus can also be built into a <<native-exe>> with link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM].

== Usage

For now, the project needs to be built locally (requires Java 8 or above); 

----
git clone https://github.com/38leinaD/bpmn-diff.git
cd bpmn-diff
./gradlew quarkusBuild --uber-jar
----

You should find the `bpmn-diff-999-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` under `bpmn-diff/build` and example BPMN files under `bpmn-diff-webapp/resources`. We can compare them with:

----
java -jar bpmn-diff/build/bpmn-diff-999-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar ./bpmn-diff-webapp/resources/pizza-collaboration/old.bpmn ./bpmn-diff-webapp/resources/pizza-collaboration/new.bpmn
----

A browser window should open up showing the application. On close of the browser window, the application is terminated.
As the application does not ship with it's own browser, it tries to find a browser on the local system.
The steps, and how to set a specific browser, are outlined under <<browser-detection>>.

You cannot just diff individual files but also perform a diff on folders:

----
java -jar bpmn-diff/build/bpmn-diff-999-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar ./bpmn-diff/src/test/resources/diffs/dir-diff/a ./bpmn-diff/src/test/resources/diffs/dir-diff/b
----

=== Usage as Git difftool

Add the following to your `.gitconfig`

----
[difftool "bpmn"]
    cmd = java -jar <full-path-to-repo>/bpmn-diff/build/bpmn-diff-999-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar $LOCAL $REMOTE
    trustExitCode = false
----

==== Commands

Assuming you have a Git repository with some BPMN-files, here are some useful commands:

Diff on `flow.bpmn` between latest and previous commit:

----
git difftool -t bpmn HEAD~1 HEAD flow.bpmn
----

If you run above command without the filename, it will do a diff for the whole commit. This means, the difftool will be invoked for each file one after the other.
This is not very useful as you will have to inspect each BPMN file one after the other and the difftool will also be invoked for changes in files that are not BPMN-files.
For this reason, there is `--dir-diff` which is also supported by this tool: 

----
git difftool --dir-diff -t bpmn HEAD~1 HEAD
----

This will open a pane to switch between files.
[[native-exe]]
== Native Executable

You either need to have GraalVM installed or Docker.

If you have GraalVM installed and have set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable, run:

----
./gradlew buildNative
----

This is the only option for Windows users and will require an installation of Visual Studio.

If you are in a linux-based environment and have Docker installed, you may also build a native executable by running:

----
./gradlew buildNative --docker-build=true
----

[[browser-detection]]
== Browser Detection

The tool opens the difftool in a browser installed on your system. By default the `BestFit` strategy is used which will try to detect an appropriate browser in the following way:

. If the environment variable `BROWSER_COMMAND` is defined, run this with the URL of the webapp as parameter.
. If the executable `google-chrome` is detected on your `PATH`, use this executable.
. If the executable `firefox` is detected on your `PATH`, use this executable.
. Else, ask the operating system to use the default browser.

Other strategies can be selected via the command-line flag `-browser=`. Values are `BestFit`, `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `System`.
`System` will try to use whatever browser is configured by the operating system.

TODO: Testing has been done with Linux only. So, setting  `Chrome` or`Firefox` might fail on windows as it only checks if specifically named executables are found on the `PATH`.
