= BPMN difftool for Git

This tool is a repackaging of https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-diffing (see here for the link:https://demo.bpmn.io/diff[online version])
allowing it to be invoked from the commandline.
Furthermore, this allows it to be used as a Git link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool[difftool].

== Usage

For now, build the project locally:

----
git clone https://github.com/38leinaD/bpmn-diff.git
cd bpmn-diff
./gradlew build
----


You should now find the `bpmn-diff.jar` under `bpmn-diff/build/libs` and example BPMN files under `bpmn-diff-webapp/resources`. We can compare them with:

----
java -jar bpmn-diff/build/libs/bpmn-diff.jar ./bpmn-diff-webapp/resources/pizza-collaboration/old.bpmn ./bpmn-diff-webapp/resources/pizza-collaboration/new.bpmn
----

A browser windows should open up showing the webapp. On close of the browser, the application should terminate.

=== Git Difftool

Add the following to your `.gitconfig`

----
[difftool "bpmn"]
    cmd = java -jar <full-path-to-repo>/bpmn-diff/build/libs/bpmn-diff.jar $LOCAL $REMOTE
    trustExitCode = false
----

Assuming you have a Git repository with a BPMN-file you can compare the BPMN-file of the current commit with the last commit like this:

----
git difftool -t bpmn HEAD~1 HEAD flow.bpmn
----

== Todos

* Diff folders; not just single files
